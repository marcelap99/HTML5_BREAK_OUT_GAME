# HTML5 BREAK OUT GAME


##Description: Front End Game:

2D breakout game using pure JavaScript rendered in HTML canvas.

Implemented DPI fix to correct excessive blur.

However this has caused a bug with the timing of

the requestAnimationFrame() method. Mid research

on fixing the timing / speed bug.
